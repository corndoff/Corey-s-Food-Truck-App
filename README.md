# Corey-s-Food-Truck-App
This is a Kotlin food truck POS system app that uses MVVM architecture and Room database. In this app customers can choose the food they want, add or delete items from the checkout page, and place their orders using a card payment.
The order gets placed with the table the customer is sitting at, which they input. The orders go to the cooks database which displays all new orders in time-in order.
Once the cooks have finished with the order they mark it complete and it gets moved to the servers database which prompts them to either call out the table number or bring it to the customer.
